# Roa.ai-V2-
yes, the second version it was a mobile app last time now its a .exe file for my monster laptop


### Now how does this work?

    first of all install dark-champion model from hugging gface -> preferably q4-k-m 

    link-> https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/Llama-3.2-8X3B-MOE-Dark-Champion-Instruct-uncensored-abliterated-18.4B-GGUF

    why? well cuz m just has better coverage not too detailed not too vague and its a moe

    now after dark-champion 
    install qwen coder 2.5 7b instruct q5_k_m link-> https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct

### What does it do?
   Its a privacy focused, local ai assistant that has capabilities of websearch and vpn based search as well 
   got vpn through hide.me ... make an account there and in your windows network and security tab change the server name to the one that they give you for free, your email and your password. and also change the vpn to internet key exchange v2 cuz your machine it is fast (more than enough). preferably try proton vpn as an alternative. 

### Features
  1. Web Based Search 
  2. Menus - Personal, Random, Diary, Coder and Context. All of these have save chat feature which you can later use it as memory for Dark Champion 
  3. Context - just put any pdf,docx / github link and it gives you the summary of it. it uses pdf reader have to shift to pymupdf for epub also
  4. Only coder uses qwen. 
  5. Theres Vpn based search as well. 

### Conclusion 

     Yes, this project was heavily inspired from pewdiepie's STOP USING AI video and i know there isnt much creativity here but i wanted to implement this for -> 1. got new laptop 2. I really liked his project.
